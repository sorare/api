# Changelog

All notable changes to the Sorare GraphQL API will be documented in this file. We reserve the right to remove deprecated fields after they've been deprecated for more than 1 month.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## 2023-01-26

## 2023-01-16

## 2023-01-10

### Changed

GraphQL complexity limits have been updated to reflect a change in the computation algorithm. Some array-based GraphQL fields were not accounted for and will now be taken into account (eg. `soScore.allAroundStats` or `englishAuction.cards`). The new algorithm computes GraphQL complexity that are generally higher than the old one so we have bumped the (authenticated) limit to 30k.

Clarified subscription complexity limits.

## 2022-12-13

### Changed

`currentUser.accountEntries` now returns entries related to market fees (where entry type is `PAYMENT_FEE`) and is also filterable on the `entryType` field.

## 2022-12-02

### Added

A query `tokenPrices` has been added. It returns the last 5 public prices (either from Auction or SingleSaleOffer) for a given player, rarity and collection.

## 2022-11-08

### Changed

- When creating a `SingleSaleOffer` through the `createSingleSaleOffer` mutation, the `start_date` now defaults to "2 minutes in the future" (instead of the current timestamp). This creates a grace period during which the offer can be canceled before it becomes public.

### Deprecated

Deprecated the following field from `So5Leaderboard`:

- `scoringEngine`

Deprecated the following field from `Card`:

- `priceRange` (use `Token.priceRange` instead, which works across collections)

## 2022-11-04

### BREAKING CHANGES

A `feeInfo` field of type `Fee` is added on `LimitOrder` type and is now mandatory on the following mutation when interacting with the secondary market:

- for direct offer creation: `prepareOffer` mutation.
- for single sale offer acceptance: `prepareAcceptOffer` mutation, see the [updated example](examples/acceptSingleSaleOffer.js).

This new `feeInfo` field must be part of the payload that will be signed with the `signLimitOrder` method
provided by the [`@sorare/crypto`](https://github.com/sorare/crypto) package or any other method you will use.

Please note that these changes are only required for offers containing MLB or NBA cards, and an ETH amount.
