### BREAKING CHANGES

Some high-cardinality sets of objects won't be retrievable while being nested in a collection/connection. (eg. you can retrieve the followers of a single User but won't be able to retrieve them on multiple users in a single GraphQL query). This applies to:

- user.followers
- user.following
- user.buyingEnglishAuctions
- user.paginatedLiveSingleSaleOffers
- user.endedWithNoBuyerSingleSaleOffers
- country.openAuctions
- user.customDecks
- team.openAuctions
- team.players
- team.activePlayers
- team.recentDepartures
- team.activeMemberships
- team.latestGames
- team.games
- card.playerSeasonPicture
- card.teamPictureUrl
- competition.clubs
- so5Fixture.so5Leagues
- so5Fixture.mySo5Lineups
- so5Fixture.mySo5Games
- so5Fixture.so5Leaderboards
- so5Fixture.mySo5Rewards
- so5Fixture.mySo5Rankings
- so5Fixture.orderedSo5Scores
- so5Fixture.orderedSo5ScoresByPosition
- so5Fixture.next
- so5Fixture.previous
- so5Leaderboard.so5Rankings
- so5Leaderboard.so5RankingsPreview
- so5Leaderboard.so5Rewards
- so5Leaderboard.so5LineupsPaginated
- so5Leaderboard.so5RankingsPaginated

### REMOVED

Some fields have been removed from the API. They have been marked as deprecated and you can still query them for now but the response will always be empty. This applies to:

- currentUser.subscriptions
- so5Leaderboard.so5Lineups
- so5Appearance.so5Game
- card.mintedSingleSaleOffer

### ADDED

Additional fields are now accessible to OAuth authenticated calls. This applies to:

- card.myMintedSingleSaleOffer
- card.currentUserSingleBuyOfferMinPrice
- card.liveSingleBuyOffers
- card.canBuy
- currentUser.followers
- currentUser.following
